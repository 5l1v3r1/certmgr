## Changelog:
This is a beta build of the completely re-worked CertMgr application suitable for anyone interested in using the newest features and probably giving feedback about things that are not yet working as expected.

Main enhancements compared to the previous 0.2.x version are:
* New GUI layout
* More import/export options
* Support for user defined certificate templates
* Extended algorithm options via expert mode

All functions should merely work as expected.
However as this is still a beta build it will definitely still contain bugs and may even cause data loss.
