<h1>Certificate Export</h1>
This dialog is used to export the currently selected certificate. The export options include the export format, the
export target as well as the actual certificate objects to export.

<p/>
Certificate data can be exported in either PEM or PKCS#12 format. Depending on the export format different export target
options are available:
<ul>
<li>File</li>
Everything is written to a single file.
<li>Folder</li>
The selected certificate objects are written to individual files in the chosen target folder. The individual file names
are derived from the certificate's alias.
<li>Clipboard</li>
The selected certificate objects are copied to the clipboard as a single text stream.
</ul>
<p/>
Per default the exported data will be encrypted. If this option is selected a <a href="topic_newpasswordprompt.html">password prompt</a>
will come up during export to enter the export password.
<p/>
The remaining options determine which certificate objects are exported:
<ul>
<li>Export certificate</li>
Include the certificate object in the export.
<li>Include certificate chain</li>
Include the chain of issuing certificates in the export.
<li>Include root certificate</li>
Include the issuing root certificate in the export.
<li>Export key</li>
Include the key in the export. If this option is selected a <a href="topic_passwordprompt.html">password prompt</a>
will come up during export to enter the key password.
<li>Export CSR</li>
Include the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in the export.
<li>Export CRL</li>
Include the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in the export.
</ul>
<p/>
Options not applicable for the selected entry are grayed out.
