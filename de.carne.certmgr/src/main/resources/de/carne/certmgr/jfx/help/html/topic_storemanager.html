<h1>Certificate Manager overview</h1>
The Certificate Manager application supports creation and management of X.509 certificates and corresponding objects.
<p/>
The application organizes the certificate objects in so called certificate stores. Technically a store is nothing more
than a directory. The directory name denotes the store name. The different certificate objects are organized in sub-directories.
<h2>Certificate Store view</h2>
This is the main window of the application. The left pane shows the certificate objects contained in the currently opened
store. The certificate objects are arranged according to their certification path. The right pane shows the details of
the currently selected certificate object. The bottom pane shows application messages like progress and status information
as well as warning and error messages issued by the application.
