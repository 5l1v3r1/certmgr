<h1>Password required</h1>
This dialog is displayed whenever a password protected object is accessed (e.g. a private key during signing or import
of password protected objects).

<p/>
The prompt message shows for which object the password is required. The dialog will be displayed again if the entered
password is not valid. An additional message shows the cause for rejecting the password.
<p/>
By selecting the option "Remember password" the entered password will be remembered for the next time a password is
required during the current operation. In case of a password mismatch the dialog will be displayed again to ask for
a different password.
<p>
Selecting the cancel option will cancel the current access. Selecting the cancel all option will select all accesses
of the current operation.
